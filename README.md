# Nasa-Space-Apps-Landsat
Our project allows users to define a target location by specifying the place name, latitude and longitude, or selecting a location on a map. It determines when a Landsat satellite is passing over the specified location and enables users to set a cloud coverage threshold (e.g., returning only data with less than 15% cloud coverage over land).
